# AmpliconArchitect (AA)


Focal oncogene amplification and rearrangements drive tumor growth and evolution in multiple cancer types. Proposed mechanisms for focal amplification include extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) formation, breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) mechanism, tandem duplications, chromothripsis and others. Focally amplified regions are often hotspots for genomic rearrangements. As a result, the focally amplified region may undergo rapid copy number changes and the structure of the focally amplified region may evolve over time contributing to tumor progression. ecDNA originating from distinct genomic regions may recombine to form larger ecDNA elements bringing together multiple oncogenes for simultaneous amplification. Furthermore, ecDNA elements may reintegrate back into the genome to form HSRs. The inter-cell heterogeneity in copy number of ecDNA as well as the interchangeability between ecDNA and HSR may allow the tumor to adapt to changing environment, e.g. targetted drug application. As a result, understanding the architecture of the focal amplifications is important to gain insights into tumor progression as well as response to treatment. AmpliconArchitect (AA) is a tool which can reconstruct the structure of focally amplified regions in a cancer sample using whole genome sequence short paired-end data.

A full description of the methods and detailed characterization of copy number amplifications and ecDNA in cancer can be found in the following manuscript. Please cite the following reference if using AmpliconArchitect in your work:

## The AA Algorithm
A full description of the methods and detailed characterization of copy number amplifications and ecDNA can be found in the manuscript referenced in the introduction.
### Definitions:
1. Amplicon: A set of genomic intervals connected together and amplified in copy number
2. Amplicon structure(s): Ordered list(s) of segments from the amplicon intervals present in the sample.
### Inputs:
1. BAM file: WGS reads mapped to the human genome
2. BED file: Set of seed intervals to be used for searching and reconstructing the amplicons in the sample. User should provide at least 1 seed per amplicon.
### Algorithm:
AA implements various steps to predict the structure of the amplicons:
1. Interval set determination: Determine the list of intervals for each amplicon to be reconstructed.
2. SV detection: Detect copy number changes and structural variations using coverage and discordant read pairs within each amplicon.
3. Breakpoint graph construction: Construct a breakpoint graph consisting of sequence egdes (genomic segments), breakpoint edges (pairs of connected genomic positions) and optionally a source vertex and predict copy counts for all edges.
4. Cycle decomposition: Decompose the breakpoint graph into simple cycles which provide a simple representation of predicted amplicon structures.
5. Interactive cycle merging: Provide a web interface to interactively merge and modify the cycles to explore candidate structures.

### Outputs:
AA generates informative output at each step in the algorithm (details below):
1. Summary file: List of amplicons and corresponding intervals are listed in a summary file.
2. SV view: A PNG/PDF image for each amplicon displaying all rearrangement signatures. Underlying data is provided in text format as intermediate files.
3. Graph file: For each amplicon, a text file describing the graph and predicted copy count.
4. Cycles file: For each amplicon: a text file describing the list of simple cycles predicted.
5. Cycle view: A web interface with operations for visualizing and modifying the simple cycles.

The user may provide intermediate files as a way to either kickstart AA from an intermediate step or to use alternative intermediate data (e.g. from external tools) for reconstruction.

## AmpliconArchitect reconstruction

### 1) Input data:
AA requires 2 input files:

1. Coordinate-sorted, indexed BAM file:
    * Align reads to a reference present in the `data_repo`.
    * AA has been tested on `bwa mem` on `hg19` reference genome.
    * Recommended depth of coverage for WGS data is 5X-10X.
    * Bamfile may be downsampled using `$AA_SRC/downsample.py` or when running AA with the option `--downsample`. 
    * If sample has multiple reads groups with very different read lengths and fragment size distributions, then we recommend downsampling the bam file be selecting the read groups which have similar read lengths and fragment size distribution.
2. BED file with seed intervals:
    * One or more intervals per amplicon in the sample
    * AA has been tested on seed intervals generated as follows:
        - CNVs from CNV caller ReadDepth with parameter file `$AA_SRC/src/read_depth_params`
        - Select CNVs with copy number > 5x and size > 100kbp and merge adjacent CNVs into a single interval using:

            `python $AA_SRC/amplified_intervals.py --bed {read_depth_folder}/output/alts.dat --out {outFileNamePrefix} --bam {BamFileName}`

### 2) Usage:
`$AA --bam {input_bam} --bed {bed file} --out {prefix_of_output_files} <optional arguments>`

The execution script `$AA` is provided within the Github source code and the exact path depends on the installation option used:
1. Docker image: `AA=AmpliconArchitect/docker/run_aa_docker.sh`
2. Github source: `AA=python2 AmpliconArchitect/src/AmpliconArchitect.py`

Alternatively, the user may run the visualization tool locally on port 8000 using the following commands:
```bash
export FLASK_APP=$AA_SRC/cycle_visualization/web_app.py
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```
## Instructions for web interface:
- Choose and upload a cycles files generated by AA.
- Optional but recommended: Upload corresponding png file generated AA.
- Operations:
    - Show-hide cyles by name, copy count threshold
    - Merge cycles with a common segment: Select cycle names and ments rank (NOT the ID displayed) in the order of segments played. For closed cycles, first segment rank is 0; for open walks, For n walks, first segment rank is 1 and so on.
    - Pivot cycle around inverted duplication: Pivot the portion of  cycle that connects two reversed occurences of a duplicated ment without changing any genomic connections.
    - Undo last edit: Go back to previous state.

## File Formats
### 1. Summary file (`{out}_summary.txt`)
The summary file includes a list of all amplicons and intervals within each amplicon including size, average copy number and oncogenes amplified. The first word of each line contains the amplicon ID, the second word describes the type of information in the rest of the file. (This format will be deprecated in the future to be replaced by JSON format.)

### 2. Graph file (`{out}_amplicon{id}_graph.txt`)
The graph file for each amplicon consists of 2 sections: (i) Sequence edges and (ii) Breakpoint edges. The first line in each section starts with a header for the section. The rest of the lines start with a keyword corresponding to the edge category followed by the edge coordinates, copy numbers, coverage/number of reads and other information.

Breakpoint vertices corresponding to genomic positions are listed in the format:
`{CHROM}:{POS}{STRAND}` where:
1. `{CHROM}`: chromosome name
2. `{POS}`: 0-based coordinate where the basepair of said coordinate is included in participating segment. If the actual position is unknown or outside the amplicon interval, then `{POS}` is set to `-1` corresponding to the source vertex.
3. `{STRAND}`: `+`/`'`. `+`/`-` indicates that the participating segment ends on the right or begins on the left of the corresponding basepair respectively.

* Sequence edges section:
The edges in this section correspond to a segment on the reference genome. Sequence edges are a list of non-overlapping segments covering all the intervals in the amplicon. Tab-separated fields:
    1. Sequence Edge: keyword `sequence`
    2. StartPosition: Breakpoint vertex corresponding to the coordinate of the first base in the segment. 
    3. EndPosition: Breakpoint vertex correspondong to the coordiante of the last base in the segment.
    4. PredictedCopyCount: Predicted copy number of segment.
    5. AverageCoverage: Average depth of read coverage.
    6. Size: Number of basepairs in the segment.
    7. NumberReadsMapped: Total number of reads aligning to the segment.
* Breakpoint edges section:
The edges in the section correspond to 2 positions (breakpoint vertices) in the reference genome that are connected together in the amplicon. Tab-separated fields:
    1. BreakpointEdge: keyword `discordant` - connection between two non-consecutive positions, `concordant`: connection between consecutive positions already connected in the reference genome, `source`: connection between a known genomic position and either an unknown position or a position outside amplicon interval set.
    2. StartPosition->EndPosition: `{POSITION1}->{POSITION2}` where `{POSTION1}` and `{POSITION2}` are the coordinates and strands of the connected breakpoint vertices.
    3. PredictedCopyCount: Predicted copy number of the breakpoint edge.
    4. NumberofReadPairs: Number of discordant read pairs mapping across the breakpoint edge.
    5. HomologySizeIfAvailable(<0ForInsertions): Size of homology at the breakpoint edge in terms of number of basepairs detected using the split read alignment with the largest homology. If an insertion is detected then this field is set to negative of the size of the insertion. If split reads are not found, this column is set to `None`.
    6. Homology/InsertionSequence: Sequence of the homologous sequence or insertion at the breakpoint. If split reads are not found, this column is set to `None`. If the size is `0`, then this column is empty.

### 3. Cycles files (`{out}_amplicon{id}_cycle.txt`)
This file describes the amplicon structure predicted by AA in the form of simple cycles. This file consists of 3 sections where the first word is a keyword represting the section:
1. Intervals section: List of intervals in amplicon. Tab-separated fields:
    * `Interval`: keyword
    * `{IntervalID}`: ID of the interval 1, 2, etc
    * `{CHROM}`: Chromosome name
    * `{START}`: Coordinate of the first basepair
    * `{END}`: Coordinate of the last basepair
2. Segments section: List of segments used in the structures. Tab-separated fields:
    * `Segment`: keyword
    * `{IntervalID}`: ID of the segment 1, 2, etc. 
    * `{CHROM}`: Chromosome name
    * `{START}`: Coordinate of the first basepair
    * `{END}`: Coordinate of the last basepair
3. Cycles section: List of predicted cycles. Semi-colon separated fields:
    * `Cycle={CycleID}`: ID of the cycle, largest copy numbers first
    * `Copy_count={CopyCount}`: Copy count of the cycle
    * `Segments={Segment1}{Strand1},{Segment2}{Strand2},...`: List of segments and their orientation in the structure. The last segment loops back to connect to the first segment.


**NOTE:** Segment ID `0` is reserved for connections vertex. A cycle may contain segment ID either 0 or 2 times. A cycle containing the segment 0 indicates a linear contig where the end-points are connected either to undetermined positions or to positions outside the amplicon interval set.

### 4. The SV view ({out}_amplicon{id}.png/pdf)
The SV view file is a PNG/PDF file displaying the underlying sequence signatures of the amplicon. This image consists of:
    * The set of amplicon intervals (x-axis)
    * Window-based depth of coverage across the intervals represented as histogram (grey vertical bars)
    * Segmentation of the intervals based on coverage and copy number estimate of these segments represented by (horizontal black lines spanning the segment where the y-position of the line represents the copy number)
    * Discordant read pair clusters represented as arcs where color represents orienation of the reads. Red: Length discordant in expected orientation (forward-reverse), Brown: Everted read pairs (reverse-forward), Teal: Both reads map to forward strand and Magenta: Both reads map to the reverse strand. Vertical blue lines indicate connections to source vertex.
    * Bottom panel may represent various annotations on the amplicon intervals where the default view displays oncogene annotations.

The SV view file may be uploaded to web interface for Cycle view to visualize the cycles in conjunction with the SV view.


### 5. [Intermediate] Copy number segmentation file (`{out}_{CHROM}_{START}_{END}_cnseg.txt`)
This files provides the segmentation of an interval based on coverage alone. Here `{CHROM}_{START}_{END}` represent the coordinates of the interval. First line represents the header. Tab-separated fields:
    * `{CHROM}`: Chromosome name
    * `{START}`: Coordinate of the first basepair in the segment
    * `{END}`: Coordinate of the last basepair in the segment
    * `{CN}`: Predicted copy number of segment
    * `{start_refined}`: Whether the start position of the segment could be determined at a fine resolution (300bp)
    * `{end_refined}`: Whether the end position of the segment could be determined at a fine resolution (300bp)

If the copy number segmentation is present, AA will use this file instead of calculating the interval segmentation.

### 6. [Intermediate] Unrefined edges file (`{out}_amplicon{ampliconid}_edges.txt`)
This file provides the list of discordant edges in the amplicon. If this file is present but the refined edges file (See 7) is absent, then AA will use these edges in the amplicon reconstruction and also predict additional edges at boundaries of copy number segments (from 5) which do not have a matching discordant edge. Tab-separated fields:
    * `{POSITION1}->{POSITION2}`: Breakpoint vertices corresponding to the discordant edge.
    * NumberofReadPairs: Number of discordant read pairs mapping across the breakpoint edge.
    * HomologySizeIfAvailable(<0ForInsertions): Size of homology at the breakpoint edge in terms of number of basepairs detected using the split read alignment with the largest homology. If an insertion is detected then this field is set to negative of the size of the insertion. If split reads are not found, this column is set to `None`.
    * Homology/InsertionSequence: Sequence of the homologous sequence or insertion at the breakpoint. If split reads are not found, this column is set to `None`. If the size is `0`, then this column is empty.

### 7. [Intermediate] Refined edges file (`{out}_amplicon{ampliconid}_edges_cnseg.txt`)
This file provides the list of discordant edges in the amplicon. If this file is present, then AA will use these edges as the final set of edges in the amplicon reconstruction. Tab-separated fields:
    * `{POSITION1}->{POSITION2}`: Breakpoint vertices corresponding to the discordant edge.
    * NumberofReadPairs: Number of discordant read pairs mapping across the breakpoint edge.
    * HomologySizeIfAvailable(<0ForInsertions): Size of homology at the breakpoint edge in terms of number of basepairs detected using the split read alignment with the largest homology. If an insertion is detected then this field is set to negative of the size of the insertion. If split reads are not found, this column is set to `None`.
    * Homology/InsertionSequence: Sequence of the homologous sequence or insertion at the breakpoint. If split reads are not found, this column is set to `None`. If the size is `0`, then this column is empty.


## Checkpointing and modular integration with other tools:
The user may force AA to use existing data in order to recalculate information from previous runs or use data from external tools. 
Here are instructions for using prior or external data at various stages:
1. Interval selection: The user may select intervals from each amplicon and provide them in a separate BED file. The user may then run AA separately with each amplicon (bed file) using the option `--extendmode CLUSTERED` to indicate that AA should use all intervals within the provided as a single amplicon).
2. Copy number segmentation: The user may place the copy number segmentation file in the output directory in format described in File format section 5.
3. Unrefined discordant edges: The user may place the unrefined edges file in the output directory in format described in the File format section 6.
4. Refined discordant edges: The user may place the refined edges file in the output directory in format described in the File format section 7.
