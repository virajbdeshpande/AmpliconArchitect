 AmpliconArchitect
## AmpliconArchitect (AA) is a tool to identify one or more connected genomic regions which have simultaneous copy number amplification and elucidates the architecture of the amplicon.
## In the current version, AA takes as input next generation sequencing reads (paired-end Illumina reads) mapped to the hg19/GrCH37 reference sequence and one or more regions of interest.

# Data repositories:
## Download the data repositories. While we include some annotations, we are unable to host some large files in the git repository.
## These may be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByYcg0axX7udUDRxcTdZZkg0X1k. Thanks to Peter Ulz for noticing incorrect link earlier.

# AmpliconArchitect reconstruction:

# Preprocessing:

## Input 1: Coordinate sorted bam file:
## Use bwa mem or any other software to align reads to the hg19full.fa in the data_repo human reference to output a bam file.
## Sort the bam file by genomic coordinates and index the coordinate sorted bam file using "samtools index".
## May downsample bamfile using src/downsample.py or in real time when running AmpliconArchitect.py

## Input 2: Amplicon Interval(s):
## Identify interval(s) of interest by using a CNV caller e.g. ReadDepth, but may use others or user defined intervals.
## Recommended to use file AmpliconArchitect/src/read_depth_params for calling variants with ReadDepth.
## Recommended only analyze CN gains > 5x copy count and > 100kbp in size.
## Recommended to filter out intervals with significant overlap with conserved regions.
## Input intervals in bed file format
python src/amplified_intervals.py --bed {read_depth_folder}/output/alts.dat > {outName}.bed

# Amplicon reconstruction
python src/AmpliconArchitect.py --bam <input_bam> --bed <bed file> --out <prefix for output files> --ref hg19/GRCh37
# See below python src/AmpliconArchitect.py --help for other options.


# Output description
## The software generates 4 types of output files
## 1) <outName>_summary.txt:
## This file includes a summary for all amplicons detected
## 
## 2) <outName>_amplicon<id>_graph.txt:
## For each amplicon, breakpoint graph describing sequence edges and breakpoint edges in the graph
## Edge each consists of 2 vertices in the format <chromosome>:<position><orientation>
## e.g. A sequence edge chr1:10001-->chr1:20000+ represents the 10000bp genomic sequence. A breakpoint edge chr1:10001-->chr1:20000+ implies that on chr1, the forward strand from position 20000 is continues onto the forward strand at position 10001 in the 5' to 3' direction to create a 10000bp loop. Breakpoint vertices with position -1 are reserved for source vertex at the end of linear contig.
## 
## 3) <outName>_amplicon<id>_cycle.txt:
## For each amplicon, this file represents the list of structures contained in the amplicon.
## Segments represent genomic intervals (with possible overlaps) and each segment is assigned a unique id.
## Segment id 0 is reserved for source vertices. 
## Cycles are represented as ordered lists of connected segments along with orientation of the segments.
## The last segment connects back to the first segment of the cycle.
## Linear contigs have 0+ and 0- as their first and last segments.
## May be uploaded to web interface for visualization and operations on cycles (See below).
##
## 4) <outName>_amplicon<id>.png:
## A single image file displaying the set of intervals, underlying coverage, segmentation of coverage, discordant read pairs and oncogene annotations.
## May be uploaded to web interface for visualization and operations on cycles (See below).

# Web interface
## URL: genomequery.ucsd.edu:8800
## Choose and upload a cycles files generated by AA.
## Optional but recommended: Upload corresponding png file generated by AA.
## Operations:
## a) Show-hide cyles by name, copy count threshold
## b) Merge cycles with a common segment: Select cycle names and segments rank (NOT the ID displayed) in the order of segments displayed.
##    For closed cycles, first segment rank is 0; for open walks, For open walks, first segment rank is 1 and so on.
## c) Pivot cycle around inverted duplication: Pivot the portion of the cycle that connects two reversed occurences of a duplicated segment without changing any genomic connections.
## d) Undo last edit: Go back to previous state.

##                       how the input intervals in bed file are treated. EXPLORE
##                       : Search for all connected intervals in genome that may
##                       be connected to input intervals. CLUSTERED : Input
##                       intervals are treated as part of a single connected
##                       amplicon and no new connected intervals are added.
##                       UNCLUSTERED : Input intervals are treated as part of a

##                       not use any annotations. AA can tolerate additional
##                       chromosomes not stated but accuracy and annotations may
##                       be affected. Default: hg19
##   --downsample FLOAT  Values: [-1, 0, C(>0)]. Decide how to downsample the
##                       bamfile during reconstruction. Reads are automatically
##                       downsampled in real time for speedup. Alternatively pre-
##                       process bam file using $AA_SRC/downsample.py. -1 : Do
##                       not downsample bam file, use full coverage. 0 (default):
##                       Downsample bamfile to 10X coverage if original coverage
##                       larger then 10. C (>0) : Downsample bam file to coverage
##                       C if original coverage larger than C
